# 2. Brand Voice Guidelines

## 2.1 Voice vs. Tone

- **Voice** = CQ’s consistent personality (professional, clear, confident)  
- **Tone** = adapts to context (calmer in support; more direct in product UI; more narrative in thought leadership)

## 2.2 Voice Attributes

| Voice Attribute | This Means... | This Doesn't Mean... |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Clear | Simple words, scannable structure, defined terms | Oversimplifying finance or “talking down” |
| Professional | Clean, credible, US B2B SaaS tone | Corporate buzzword soup |
| Confident | Authority and specificity | Exaggerated promises or hype |
| Precise | Numbers, proof, concrete outcomes | Vague “revolutionary” claims |
| Human | Direct “you/your team” language | Slangy, playful, overly casual |

## 2.3 Voice Spectrum (1–5)

| Dimension | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Dimension |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|-----------|
| Formal | ○ | ○ | ○ | ● | ○ | Casual |
| Serious | ○ | ○ | ○ | ● | ○ | Playful |
| Respectful | ○ | ○ | ○ | ● | ○ | Irreverent |
| Matter-of-fact | ○ | ○ | ○ | ● | ○ | Enthusiastic |
| Reserved | ○ | ○ | ● | ○ | ○ | Expressive |

**Your Position:** Professional but not stiff (4/5 formal). Calm confidence over excitement.

## 2.4 Voice Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ Do's
- Use short, scannable sentences and headings.
- Lead with outcomes (speed, visibility, diligence efficiency).
- Speak directly to the reader (“you,” “your team”).
- Use proof (customers, stats, security posture) where possible.
- Keep the writing modern US B2B SaaS: direct, minimal, crisp.

### ❌ Don'ts
- Avoid hype: “game-changing,” “revolutionary,” “unmatched.”
- Avoid jargon without definition (unless standard for audience/context).
- Avoid long paragraphs and stacked clauses.
- Avoid guarantees you cannot substantiate (e.g., “10X” without proof).

## 2.5 Voice Principles

1. **Clarity wins.** Structure first; style second.  
2. **Show the workflow.** Tie claims to real fundraising/diligence steps.  
3. **Prove it.** Prefer specifics, examples, and evidence.  
4. **Less is more.** Remove anything that doesn’t improve comprehension or conversion.  
5. **Finance-grade credibility.** Language and visuals must feel institutional.

| Support | Blocked | Patient, specific | “Here’s what’s happening and how to resolve it.” |
| Sales/marketing | Evaluating | Confident, evidence-based | “Centralize your fundraising workflow—without switching between tools.” |
| Legal/compliance | Cautious | Precise, transparent | “Here’s how we handle retention, access, and audit logs.” |
| Pricing | Calculating | Straightforward | “Choose a plan based on team size and workflow needs.” |

## 3.3 Tone Modifiers

| When the reader is... | We become more... | Example adjustment |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| New to CQ | Explanatory | Define terms; add context |
| Experienced | Direct | Skip basics; focus on differentiation |
